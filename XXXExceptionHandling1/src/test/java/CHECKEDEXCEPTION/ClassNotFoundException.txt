1.Is ClassNotFoundException an example of checked exception?
=================================================================
Ans:ClassNotFoundException is a checked exception which occurs when an application tries to load a class 
through its fully-qualified name and can not find its definition on the classpath. This occurs mainly when 
trying to load classes using Class. forName(), ClassLoader. loadClass() or ClassLoader.
