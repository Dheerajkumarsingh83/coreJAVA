Java this keyword
------------------
In Java, this is a keyword which is used to refer current object of a class. we can it to refer 
any member of the class. It means we can access any instance variable and method by using
 this keyword.

The main purpose of using this keyword is to solve the confusion when we have same variable name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 for instance and local variables.
 ----------------------------------
 
We can use this keyword for the following purpose.

this keyword is used to refer to current object.
this is always a reference to the object on which method was invoked.
this can be used to invoke current class constructor.
this can be passed as an argument to another method.
Lets first understand the most general use of this keyword. As we said, it can be used to 
differentiate local and instance variables in the class.

Example:
---------
In this example, we have three instance variables and a constructor that have three parameters
 with same name as instance variables. Now, we will use this to assign values of parameters to 
 instance variables.
 
 Here this is used to initialize member of current object. Such as, this.width refers to the 
 variable of the current object and width only refers to the parameter received in the constructor
  i.e the argument passed while calling the constructor.

Calling Constructor using this keyword
---------------------------------------
We can call a constructor from inside the another function by using this keyword

Example:
----------
In this example, we are calling a parameterized constructor from the non-parameterized
 constructor using the this keyword along with argument.
 
 Accessing Method using this keyword
---------------------------------------
This is another use of this keyword that allows to access method. We can access method using
 object reference too but if we want to use implicit object provided by Java then use 
 this keyword.

Example:
----------
In this example, we are accessing getName() method using this and it works fine as works with 
object reference. See the below example

Return Current Object from a Method
---------------------------------------
In such scenario, where we want to return current object from a method then we can use this to 
solve this problem.

Example:
----------

In this example, we created a method display that returns the object of Demo class. To return 
the object, we used this keyword and stored the returned object into Demo type reference 
variable. We used that returned object to call getName() method and it works fine.
