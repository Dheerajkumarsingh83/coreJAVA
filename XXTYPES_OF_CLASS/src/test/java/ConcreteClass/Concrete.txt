Concrete Class:
----------------
A concrete class in Java is a regular class that can be instantiated to create objects. It provides the implementation for abstract
 methods inherited from its abstract or interface parents.

Example:
----------
public class ConcreteClass extends AbstractClass {
    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Concrete class display method.");
    }
}
Output: No specific output, as it is just a class definition
-------

Sure! Here's an example of a concrete class in Java:

public class Rectangle {
    private int width;
    private int height;

    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public int getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
    }

    public int getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
    }

    public int calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
In this example, the Rectangle class represents a geometric rectangle. It has two private fields, width and height, along with their
 corresponding getters and setters. The class also includes a calculateArea() method that calculates and returns the area of the 
 rectangle based on its width and height.

You can create instances of the Rectangle class and interact with its methods like this:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 7);
        System.out.println("Width: " + rectangle.getWidth());
        System.out.println("Height: " + rectangle.getHeight());
        System.out.println("Area: " + rectangle.calculateArea());

        rectangle.setWidth(8);
        rectangle.setHeight(10);
        System.out.println("New Width: " + rectangle.getWidth());
        System.out.println("New Height: " + rectangle.getHeight());
        System.out.println("New Area: " + rectangle.calculateArea());
    }
}
Output:
----------
Width: 5
Height: 7
Area: 35
New Width: 8
New Height: 10
New Area: 80
In the above program, we create an instance of the Rectangle class with width 5 and height 7. We then display its width, height, and 
calculated area. Later, we update the width to 8 and height to 10 and display the updated values along with the new calculated area.

This example demonstrates how to define and use a concrete class in Java to represent real-world entities or concepts.
