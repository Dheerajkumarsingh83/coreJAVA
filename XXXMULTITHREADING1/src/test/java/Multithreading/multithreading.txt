Q)What is MultiThreading?
=================================================================================================
ANS:The process of executing multiple tasks (also called threads) simultaneously is called multithreading.
 The primary purpose of multithreading is to provide simultaneous execution of two or more parts of a 
 program to make maximum use of CPU time. A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can 
 run concurrently. It enables programmers to write in a way where multiple activities can proceed 
 simultaneously within a single application.
