Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a problem. It involves breaking down a complex problem
 into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Here's an example of a recursive method to calculate the factorial of a number:

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5;
        int factorial = calculateFactorial(number);
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " = " + factorial);
    }
    
    public static int calculateFactorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
        }
    }
}
Output:
---------
Factorial of 5 = 120
