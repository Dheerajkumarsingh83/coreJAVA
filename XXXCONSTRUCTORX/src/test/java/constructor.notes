Q1) Can a class have multiple constructors?
Ans: Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters.
 Which constructor gets used for object creation depends on the arguments 
 passed while creating the objects.
 
Q2) Can we override static methods of a class?
Ans: We cannot override static methods. Static methods belong to a class 
and not to individual objects and are resolved at the time of compilation 
(not at runtime).Even if we try to override static method, we will not get
 an complitaion error,nor the impact of overriding when running the code.

Q3) When the constructor of a class is invoked?
Ans: The constructor of a class is invoked every time an object is created with new keyword.

For example, in the following class two objects are created using new keyword and hence, 
constructor is invoked two times.

public class const_example {

    const_example() {

        system.out.println("Inside constructor");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {

        const_example c1 = new const_example();

        const_example c2 = new const_example();
    }
}
